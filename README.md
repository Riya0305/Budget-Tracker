# This is a real time budget tracker 

It can be used to track your spendings as well as your stock accounts

Tech stack: 
* Frontend
Framework:

React.js or Vue.js (for a modern, dynamic user interface).
Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS (for styling and responsive design).
Features:

Intuitive dashboards for tracking budgets.
Interactive charts and graphs using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
Form validations for inputs (e.g., adding expenses or income).
Tools:

Use Axios or Fetch API to call APIs from the backend.
Backend
Framework:

Django or FastAPI (if you need a lightweight, high-performance solution).
Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to create RESTful APIs for your frontend.
Real-Time Updates:

Django Channels: Add WebSocket support for live updates.
Redis: A message broker for WebSocket communication (can also be used for caching).
Authentication:

Use Django’s built-in user authentication or integrate with OAuth (e.g., Google Login).
Database
Options:

PostgreSQL: Best for scalability and advanced features like JSON storage.
SQLite: Lightweight and sufficient for small-scale projects.
Management:

Use Django’s ORM for database interactions.
Real-Time Data Storage & Messaging
Redis:

For handling WebSocket connections and real-time updates.
Store session data or frequently accessed budget summaries.
Firebase Realtime Database (optional):

An alternative for handling real-time data syncing if Redis feels complex.
APIs and Libraries
Budget Analysis:

Use Pandas for analyzing and aggregating budget data.
Use NumPy for calculations if needed.
Data Visualization:

Matplotlib or Plotly for generating backend-rendered reports and charts.
Third-Party APIs (optional):

Currency conversion APIs like Open Exchange Rates if you plan to support multiple currencies.
Plaid API for integrating with bank accounts to fetch transactions directly.
Deployment
Cloud Provider:

Heroku: Simple deployment with add-ons like PostgreSQL and Redis.
AWS or Google Cloud: For more control and scalability.
Web Server:

Gunicorn or Uvicorn for serving the application.
Containerization (optional):

Use Docker to containerize the application for easy deployment and scaling.
Version Control & Collaboration
GitHub or GitLab:
For source code management and collaboration.
CI/CD:
GitHub Actions or CircleCI for continuous integration and automated testing.
Testing
Backend:
Use Python’s unittest or pytest.
Frontend:
Use Jest (for React.js) or Vue Test Utils (for Vue.js).
Integration Testing:
Tools like Postman for testing APIs.
Optional Add-Ons
Notifications:

Twilio for SMS alerts.
Push Notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
Machine Learning (future feature):

Use Scikit-learn to predict future budget trends.
